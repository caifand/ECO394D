# Load the data:
# Click the Import Dataset button under the Environment tab at right.
# Use it to import the data in predimed.csv
# Make sure that:
# - You use "From Text (base)"
# - You check "Yes" next to Heading

# Examine the first few lines of the data frame:
# Each row is a person, each column is a variable.
# variables like group, sex, and smoke are categorical.
# variables like age and bmi are numerical.
head(predimed)

# look at some "favorite stats" for the age variable
favstats(predimed$age)

# Let's get a summary for all the variables in the data set

# Make a table for event versus diet group
# xtabs means "cross tabulate" and the tilde (~) means "by"
# This says "cross-tabulate the predimed data by group and event"

# Use this table to estimate:
#  P(event | Control diet)

# Note: you can use R just like a calculator, e.g. 3/(3+7)
